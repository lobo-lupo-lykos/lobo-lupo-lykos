ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m [Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononymous_person), however that username
was long since taken, and as this is meant to be my 'work' account I based my username on
the metre of veni, vidi, vici, using the word for 'Wolf' in the language of my heritages;
Mexican, Italian, and Greek respectively. It's pronounced like low-bow, loo-poh, lee-kos.

ðŸ“« My main account is @WolfWings for personal side-projects and minor creations.  Most of
my contact information is kept on that account instead.
